# Client

## Summary
This client application is responsible for sending data to the server. It acts as a data provider, collecting information from various sources and pushing it to the backend server for processing and storage.

## Prerequisites
- /Server
- Node.js 20+
- Appropriate access to network resources for data collection and server communication

## Installation
```bash
cd client
npm install
```

## Running the Project
Ensure that the server is up and running before starting the client. To start the client application:
```bash
npm run start
```
This will execute the client script, which starts data collection and transmission to the server.


## Running the Tests
```bash
npm run test
```

## Improvements
- **Exception Handling:** Enhance error handling to manage network failures and server downtime gracefully.
- **Testing Scenarios:** Increase test coverage to include more real-world interaction scenarios and edge cases.
- **Vulnerability Detection:** Regularly update dependencies to mitigate potential security vulnerabilities.
- **Error Monitoring:** Implement logging and error reporting mechanisms to monitor the client's operational status.
- **Code Quality:** Integrate Prettier and ESLint for consistent code formatting and linting.
- **CI/CD:** Establish automated build and test pipelines to ensure code quality and facilitate seamless deployments.
